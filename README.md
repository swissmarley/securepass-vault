## Features

### User Profiles

- **Profile Creation:** Users can create profiles with a unique username and a securely encrypted master password.
- **Profile Login:** Existing users can log in with their username and master password.

### Record Management

- **Record Modification:** Users can modify existing records by updating service names, usernames, and passwords.
- **Record Deletion:** Users can delete records they no longer need.

### Security Measures

#### Master Password

- **Hashing:** Master passwords are hashed using the bcrypt library to protect against rainbow table attacks.
- **Encryption:** Hashed master passwords are further encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm from the cryptography library.

#### Record Storage

- **Username and Password Encryption:** Usernames and passwords for records are hashed using bcrypt and then encrypted before being stored in the database.

### Additional Features

- **Password Suggestion:** The application can suggest strong passwords using the secrets module.
